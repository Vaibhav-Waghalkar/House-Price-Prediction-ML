
# üè† House Price Prediction System using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on various features like area, number of rooms, garage area, and overall quality using a machine learning model trained on the Kaggle House Prices dataset.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset from Kaggle
- Trained using Regression Models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, etc.)
- Feature importance analysis
- Predict house prices using custom input
- Well-organized codebase for training and prediction
